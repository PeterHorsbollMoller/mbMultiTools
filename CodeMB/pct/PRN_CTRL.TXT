Kiev Software Factory's Printer Control Tool (PCT) consists of a DLL (16 and
32-bit versions are included) and MapBasic sample code to set the control
values in MapInfo Pro's 'Page Setup' dialog box.

The package includes the following files:

  DLLs:
    exec_c16.dll    16-bit version.
    exec_c32.dll    32-bit version.

  MapBasic:
    exec_lib.def    DLL structures, constants, and functions definitions.
    prn_opt.mb      SetPrinterOptions and SetPageOrient subroutines source.
    prn_demo.mb     demonstration program source.
    prn_demo.mbp    demonstration program project.
    prn_demo.mbx    demonstration program.
    prn_land.mb     set printer to landscape mode source.
    prn_land.mbp    set printer to landscape mode project.
    prn_land.mbx    set printer to landscape mode program.
    prn_land.wor    set printer to landscape mode workspace.
    prn_port.mb     set printer to portrait mode source.
    prn_port.mbp    set printer to portrait mode project.
    prn_port.mbx    set printer to portrait mode program.
    prn_port.wor    set printer to portrait mode workspace.
    mi32bit.def     platform identification function definition.
    mi32bit.mb      platform identification function.

There are two MapBasic subroutines in prn_opt.mb:

  SetPageOrient     to set the page orientation to landscape or portrait with
                    one parameter:
    OrientType      orientation of the page (ORIENT_PORTRAIT or
                    ORIENT_LANDSCAPE)

  SetPrinterOptions to set all the printer options available in dialog. Its
                    parameters are:
    OrientType      orientation of the page (ORIENT_PORTRAIT or
                    ORIENT_LANDSCAPE),
    SizeInd         index of the item in Size combo box, 
    SrcInd          index of the item in Source combo box, 
    Smargins        structure describing margins.

    Note that if you don't want to pass some parameter, use 0 for numerical
    parameters and "" for strings (fields in Margins structure).

MapBasic Demonstration (prn_demo.mbx) Notes

  Run prn_demo and it adds four menu options to the File menu.

  Select "File > All Options" item to see how it works. Unfortunately,
  it is possible to set up the margins in MapInfo 32-bit only.

DLL (exec_c16.dll and exec_c32.dll) Notes

  The DLL has two exported function: ExecuteCommandScript and GetCommands.
  You can find the description of the 16 and 32-bit versions in
  exec_lib.def file.

  ExecuteCommandScript has three parameters:

    WinTitle - title of the window with controls: "Page Setup"
    Commands - array of the commands: Cmds(NumCmd) As CommandDescr
    NumCmd - number of commands in Commands array

  Each element of Commands array has the following type:

    Type CommandDescr
      CtrlID As Integer - ID of the control (use pre-defined values,
                          as ORIENT_PORTRAIT, or your own which you can find
                          with a utility such as MS Spy++).
      CmdType As SmallInt - type of command. Now only pre-defined commands
                            are supported:
        WM_COMMAND - click the button (radio- or push-),
        WM_SETTEXT - set up the value of an edit box (sValue - new text),
        CB_SETCURSEL - select the string in combo box or list box
                       (iValue-index, note index is zero based).
        WM_GETCHECK - to read the status of radio-button/check box.
        WM_GETTEXT - to read value of edit control.
        CB_GETCURSEL - to read item number in combo-box.
      iValue As Integer - integer value used for message. 
      sValue As String*MAXSTRLEN - string value used for message. 
    End Type

Writing current settings:
  1) prepare the commands list (don't forget to close dialog using
     ID = 1 and WM_COMMAND as last command);
  2) execute the script with ExecuteCommandScript() function;
  3) load the dialog with MapBasic's Run Menu Command M_FILE_PAGE_SETUP


Reading current settings:
  1) prepare the commands list as usual (don't forget to close dialog using
     ID = 1 and WM_COMMAND as last command);
  2) execute the script with ExecuteCommandScript() function;
  3) load the dialog with MapBasic's Run Menu Command M_FILE_PAGE_SETUP
  4) read the results using GetCommands() function with the second
     parameter set to the number of value you are interested in.

  Then, use iValue field for WM_GETCHECK (0 - clear, 1 - checked, 2 - mixed),
  sValue for WM_GETTEXT (just string value, use RTrim$ to cut off the space),
  iValue for CB_GETCURSEL (0-based item number).

  Sample prn_demo shows how to read page orientation (GetPareOrient function),
  and all printer options (GetPrinterOptions sub).
